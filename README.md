# Repository Name

This repository contains [**Back-End-Web-Development-1---HTTP-5125**](https://github.com/Nitish-542/http-5125).

In this course, I learned server-side web development using **C#**. I explored how to create data-driven websites and gained hands-on experience in pulling data from various external sources. My skills in building robust web applications with **ASP.NET** have been further developed, enhancing my ability to create dynamic and interactive websites.
